      'Lions are social animals, living in groups called prides. Lions are apex predators, meaning they have no natural predators in the wild. A lion’s roar can be heard up to 8 km away, which is used to communicate with other lions. Lions are the only cats that live in groups, with a pride consisting of females, their cubs, and a few males Male lions have manes, which help protect their necks during fights and also make them look larger and more intimidating Lions spend most of their day resting—about 20 hours a day, in fact! Female lions do most of the hunting, while males protect the pride and defend their territory Lions can run at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour in short bursts, though they can’t sustain this for long distances.'

    facts: [
      'Dolphins are highly intelligent and have the ability to learn complex tasks Dolphins use echolocation to navigate and hunt for food, emitting sound waves that bounce off objects to create a mental map of their surroundings Dolphins are social creatures and live in groups called pods, which can range from a few individuals to hundreds Dolphins have been known to communicate with each other through clicks, whistles, and body movements. Some species of dolphins, like the bottlenose dolphin, are known for their playful behavior, including surfing waves and playing with objects. Dolphins are highly empathetic and have been observed helping injured members of their pod and even other species. Most dolphins live in warm, shallow waters, but some species, like the orca (killer whale), are found in colder oceans. Dolphins sleep with one hemisphere of their brain at a time, allowing them to stay alert for predators and breathe while sleeping.'
